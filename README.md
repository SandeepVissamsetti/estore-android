Architecture: 
Clean architecture with MVVM. Used Android arch components - Viewmodels, live data

Testing:
Unit testing with Mockito, Junit

Dependency injection:
Hilt - Wrapper around dagger which reduces a lot of boiler plate code

Data binding:
Reduces the amount of boiler plate code needed to connect the UI with code.

Improvements to do:

Better UI while loading items - introduce progress bar
More unit test coverage
